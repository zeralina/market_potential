In 2023, Company N wants to start importing used cars into Russia for the purpose of selling them. My task is to understand which market is most favourable for purchases.
From open sources, I have obtained data on car sales in India. We need to analyse it to understand how this market is structured, how it is structured and how prices are distributed. 
This will help in deciding whether to enter this market or not.

The company has a restriction on importing cars older than 6 years. 
This means that my request is satisfied by cars manufactured no later than 2017 inclusive. 
At the same time, they must have an engine displacement not exceeding 2 litres (2000 cc).

In the next step, I needed to study the market structure and pricing mechanisms to understand which price segment cars are mostly sold in India.

Then I needed to verify that they don't sell old cars with high mileage in India. 

Then I checked how fast the used car range is being updated in India.

In the last step, I calculated the ‘quality’ index of cars. I needed to know if there are many cars with good features in the Indian market.
I came up with a special index to assess this. If the average value of the index across the market is more than 20, then such a market is considered promising.
