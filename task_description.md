In 2023, Company N wants to start importing used cars into Russia for the purpose of selling them. My task is to understand which market is most favourable for purchases.
From open sources, I have obtained data on car sales in India. I needed to analyse it to understand how this market is structured, how it is structured and how prices are distributed. 
This would help in deciding whether to enter this market or not.

The company had a restriction on importing cars older than 6 years. 
This meant that my request was satisfied by cars manufactured no later than 2017 inclusive. 
At the same time, they must have had an engine displacement not exceeding 2 litres (2000 cc).

In the next step, I needed to study the market structure and pricing mechanisms to understand which price segment cars were mostly sold in India.

Then I needed to verify that they didn't sell old cars with high mileage in India. 

Then I checked how fast the used car range was being updated in India.

In the last step, I calculated the ‘quality’ index of cars. I needed to know if there were many cars with good features in the Indian market.
I came up with a special index to assess this. If the average value of the index across the market was more than 20, then such a market was considered promising.
